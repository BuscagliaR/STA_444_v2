# Introduction to Data Science with R

This is a Git Repository for the updated book used to teach STA 444/445 at Northern Arizona University. The book is hosted [https://bookdown.org/rb76/444/](https://bookdown.org/rb76/444/).

This is the second edition of this textbook being updated with new content and material.  The original version is credited to Dr. Derek Sonderegger, and can be found at [https://bookdown.org/dereksonderegger/Introduction_to_DataScience_with_R/](https://bookdown.org/dereksonderegger/Introduction_to_DataScience_with_R/)

These notes began before Hadley Wickham had created his R for data science book but there is quite a lot of similarity. The largest distinction is that these notes try to give a gentle first introduction to various topics (chapters 1-7) which students progress through in the first 5 weeks of a semester (STA 444). At that point students have had enough R to get through an introductory statistics course. The "STA 445" section gets into more advanced issues meant to aid the BS Data Science students, or those interested in furthering their Data Science skills. STA 445 is not intended for all students.

As I continue to update this textbook, I am pleased to be given any information on typos, errors, broken links, or outdated packages. Please contact me at robert.buscaglia@nau.edu with any information regarding updates you would like to see to the textbook.
